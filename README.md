<h2 align="center">About Us</h2>

We are an Austin, TX meetup about all things web+mobile. We are language/framework agnostic, and we cover different topics each month, with a focus on front end technology.

We meet at the offices of Aunt Bertha (near Mopac and Anderson Lane) from 6-8 pm on the 4th Wednesday of each month.

Follow [@edgeATX](https://twitter.com/edgeatx) for news and updates.
